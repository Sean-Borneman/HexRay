This is a reverse engineering challenge program that implements a binary search-based flag verification system. The main function prompts the user to enter a flag, then processes each character of the input through a binary search algorithm that generates a sequence of comparison operations ('<', '>', '=') based on finding each character's ASCII value in the range 0-255. The resulting sequence is compared against a pre-stored target array. If the input flag is exactly 71 characters long (0x47) and produces a sequence that matches the 448-byte (0x1c0) target pattern, it prints "Correct!", otherwise "Nope". The program uses standard library functions through PLT stubs and includes stack canary protection.
