This is a reverse engineering challenge program that implements a flag verification system using a binary search encoding algorithm. The main function prompts the user to enter a flag, then processes each character of the input through a binary search routine that generates a sequence of '<', '>', and '=' characters based on how the binary search converges to find each character value (searching in range 0-255). The resulting encoded sequence is compared against a pre-stored target array. If the input flag is less than 71 characters and produces exactly 448 (0x1c0) encoded characters that match the target pattern, it prints "Correct!", otherwise "Nope". The program includes standard ELF initialization/finalization functions and uses stack canaries for protection.
