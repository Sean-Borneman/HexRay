This program implements a reverse engineering challenge based on binary search patterns. The user enters a flag, and for each character in the flag, the program performs a binary search in the range 0-255 to find that character's ASCII value. During the search, it records '<' when the search goes to the lower half, '>' when it goes to the upper half, and '=' when the character is found. The sequence of these comparison symbols forms a pattern that must exactly match a pre-defined target pattern of 448 characters. The challenge is to determine what input string would generate the specific target pattern through this binary search process.
